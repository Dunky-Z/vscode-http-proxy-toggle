# VSCode Proxy Toggle

## Introduction

This extension is used to toggle the proxy settings in VSCode. When opening remote servers such as WSL in VSCode, if you want the remote server to use a proxy, you need to switch the proxy address to the IP of the remote server. This extension allows for quick toggling between local and remote proxies.

## Usage

After installing the plugin, a proxy icon will appear in the status bar of VSCode. Clicking this icon will toggle the proxy settings. Proxy addresses can be configured by searching for `Http Proxy Toggle` in the settings.
